## The Metonic Cycle

When enabled in settings, a metonic cycle tracker appears at the bottom of the application window. This shows the current year's position in the 19-year metonic cycle, which is fundamental to many lunar calendars.

The metonic cycle is a period of 19 years in which the phases of the moon recur on the same day of the year. It contains 235 lunar months (12 years with 12 months and 7 years with 13 months).

Click the question mark (?) button next to the tracker for more information about the metonic cycle.

## Import and Export Settings

At the bottom of the settings dialog, there are buttons to import and export settings:

- **Import Config**: Load settings from a previously exported configuration file.
- **Export Config**: Save your current settings to a file that can be imported later or shared with others.

## Context-Sensitive Help

Each tab in the settings dialog has a help button that provides context-sensitive information about the current tab's settings.

## Applying Settings

- Click **Apply** to apply settings without closing the dialog.
- Click **OK** to apply settings and close the dialog.
- Click **Cancel** to discard changes and close the dialog.
